# Prototypical tool BPMN+TD

The code is based on the developer tutorials to extend Eclipse BPMN2 Modeler:
- BPMN2-Modeler/DeveloperTutorial https://github.com/rsoika/bpmn2-tutorial/
- Eclipse BPMN2 Wiki pages https://wiki.eclipse.org/BPMN2-Modeler/DeveloperTutorials

Two custom elements are supported in BPMN+TD, namely TechnicalDebtTask inheriting from Task element and TechnicalDebtItem inheriting from TextAnnotation element.

More information about Eclipse BPMN2 Modeler Plugin can be found on https://www.eclipse.org/bpmn2-modeler/


# Environment

BPMN+TD environment is similar to the environment of BPMN2-Modeler/DeveloperTutorial.
- Install Eclipse using Oxygen release.
- Install BPMN2 Modeler plugin and its dependencies into Eclipse (http://download.eclipse.org/bpmn2-modeler/updates/).
- Build the code and run.

The presented model in the paper is provided in the Project2 folder.
