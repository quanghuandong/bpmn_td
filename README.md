# Prototypical tool BPMN+TD

The code is based on the project BPMN2-Modeler/DeveloperTutorial provided by rsoika (https://github.com/rsoika/bpmn2-tutorial/) extending Eclipse BPMN2 Modeler Plugin.\ 
BPMN+TD implements two custom elements, namely TechnicalDebtTask inheriting from Task element and TechnicalDebtItem inheriting from TextAnnotation element.\
More information about Eclipse BPMN2 Modeler Plugin can be found on https://www.eclipse.org/bpmn2-modeler/


# Environment

BPMN+TD environment is similar to the environment of BPMN2-Modeler/DeveloperTutorial.
- Install Eclipse using Oxygen release.
- Install BPMN2 Modeler plugin and its dependencies into Eclipse (http://download.eclipse.org/bpmn2-modeler/updates/).
- Build the code and run.

The presented model in the paper is provided in the Project2 folder.
